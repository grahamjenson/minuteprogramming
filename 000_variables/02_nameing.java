#  Naming Variables in Maths

x = y + z                   # Now what was z again?

#  Naming Variables in Physics

F = m * a                      # m represents... ummm... momentum? 

#  Naming Variables in Programming

accerlation = 9.8 
mass = 10
force = accerlation * mass

# Naming varaibles after what they contain is so much better

this_is_a_varaible  #  snake_case is used in Ruby, Python, C++
thisIsAVaraible     #  camelCase is used in Java, C#, Pascal

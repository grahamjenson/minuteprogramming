# Outline
A programming variable is just a named box that may contain a value.

To create and name a variable you "declare" it, 
then you can "assign" a value to the variable. 
The reason why we call them variables is because their value can be changed, which is opposed to a "constant" whose value cannot be changed.

# Conventions

What you name a variable doesn't really matter (mostly), 
but it is a good idea to be consistent and name your variables something meaningful, 
otherwise your code will quickly become an unreadable mess.


# Languages

Languages can differ in how to use variables, 
most languages let you skip declaring a variable and go straight to assigning it a value, 
and some wont let you declare a variable without assigning a value.

The type of the value, like numbers, strings, or booleans, may be important as well. 
Dynamically typed Languages let a variables be assigned any type, 
where statically typed languages let a variable be assigned only one type.


# Not Maths  more Physics
Programming Variables are a bit different to those from maths, e.g. in maths if X=X+Y then Y = 0 , but in programming this will assign a new value to X of its old value plus Ys value.

This makes Programming Variables are a bit more like physics, where the values of variables change with respect to time. 

And like physics, by starting with only a few variables and simple definitions, 
you can quickly build up to and solve complex problems.

That is what programming is all about,
using simple tools to do complicated things.
